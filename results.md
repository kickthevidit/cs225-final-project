# BFS


# Dijkstra's
Our Dijkstra's was used to find the shortest path between two airports. The function takes in a 2D vector representing our adjacency matrix, and two integers, representing the ID's of the designated start and end airports. We use 3 vectors: a vector of ints (dist) to keep track of the shortest path from the source to each node, a vector of bools (sptSet) to keep track if each node has been visited yet, and another vector of ints (parents) to keep track of the index of the parent of each node in this traversal. From there, we iteratively traverse the adjacency list
